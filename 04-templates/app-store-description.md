## A/B Testing Ideas

### Test These Elements

1. **First screenshot** - Feature vs. lifestyle image
2. **App icon** - Color variations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keyword stuffing** - Reads unnaturally, may be rejected
2. **Making promises** - "Best app" or "Guaranteed results"
3. **Competitor mentions** - Not allowed
4. **Platform mentions** - Don't say "Android" on iOS
5. **Price in description** - Unless it's the subscription section
6. **Too much text** - Most people skim, use bullets
7. **Missing subscription terms** - Required by stores
8. **Outdated information** - Update with each release
